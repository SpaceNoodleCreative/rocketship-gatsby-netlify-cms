Our studio is a 150m² creative space with access to a green screen, photography backgrounds and a tabletop photo studio for product photography.

On location we have a variety of equipment that can be used for free (tripods, studio lights, JIB crane). The studio is also equipped with high powered projectors and speakers for background visuals and sound.

- H﻿ello!

We encourage our clients to bring their own equipment, however for an added fee we can arrange for Blackmagic cameras and other gear to be ready on site (please reserve 1 week in advance). We can also provide cameramen, editors and other staff for your production.
